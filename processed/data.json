We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.  An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.  Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.  The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.  The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.  Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.  The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

IBC is the official voice of P and C insurance companies in Canada and works with its members to shape public policy at national and provincial levels. IBC has regional divisions with offices in Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver. IBC was formed in October 1997 from the restructuring of Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) and Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau (ICPB). On April 30, 1998 Association of Canadian Insurers (ACI) resolved to merge with IBC. IBC has three operating divisions Issues Management which is involved with policy development and government relations; Investigative Services Division (ISD) (which is involved with the prevention, detection and investigation of insurance crime and fraud); and Insurance Information Division (IID), which collects, collates and analyzes actuarial, statistical and other information relevant to the field of general insurance and concerning vehicles and vehicle parts. IBC is the government-designated statistical agent for automobile insurance in Ontario, Alberta, the Atlantic provinces and the Territories, and for commercial liability in Ontario. IBC's role is to be active on behalf of its members. IBC does this by forecasting and responding to issues that may arise in the industry anticipating opportunities to identify, shape and influence change in support of members' business needs lobbying the federal and provincial governments to secure changes in public policy and in the business-operating environment that will benefit insurance companies and their customers. IBC works on a number of fronts to increase public understanding of home, car and business insurance. Public understanding is also fostered through IBC's five regional consumer centres, where trained personnel with many years of industry and government relations experience answers consumer inquiries.",

          "Organization business or activity summary": "Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) is the national umbrella trade association for private property and casualty (P and C) insurers in Canada. IBC is the official voice of P and C insurance companies in Canada and works with its members to shape public policy at national and provincial levels. IBC has regional divisions with offices in Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver. IBC was formed in October 1997 from the restructuring of Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) and Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau (ICPB). On April 30, 1998 Association of Canadian Insurers (ACI) resolved to merge with IBC. IBC has three operating divisions Issues Management which is involved with policy development and government relations; Investigative Services Division (ISD) (which is involved with the prevention, detection and investigation of insurance crime and fraud); and Insurance Information Division (IID), which collects, collates and analyzes actuarial, statistical and other information relevant to the field of general insurance and concerning vehicles and vehicle parts. IBC is the government-designated statistical agent for automobile insurance in Ontario, Alberta, the Atlantic provinces and the Territories, and for commercial liability in Ontario. IBC's role is to be active on behalf of its members. IBC does this by forecasting and responding to issues that may arise in the industry anticipating opportunities to identify, shape and influence change in support of members' business needs lobbying the federal and provincial governments to secure changes in public policy and in the business-operating environment that will benefit insurance companies and their customers. IBC works on a number of fronts to increase public understanding of home, car and business insurance. Public understanding is also fostered through IBC's five regional consumer centres, where trained personnel with many years of industry and government relations experience answers consumer inquiries.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.  An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.  Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.  The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.  The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.  Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.  The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.  An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.  Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.  The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.  The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.  Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.  The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.   An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.   Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.   The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.   The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.   Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.   The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.   An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.   Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.   The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.   The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.   Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.   The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.   An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.   Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.   The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.   The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.   Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.   The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.   An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.   Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.   The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.   The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.   Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.   The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.   An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.   Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.   The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.   The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.   Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.   The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",

We provide support and advocacy for our members and leadership in environmental and social stewardship and economic well-being related to the use of Canadian peatland resources.   An industry association that promotes the sustainable benefits of peat moss and protects the resource through active wetlands preservation and reclamation practices.   Formed in 1988 to promote the benefits of peat to horticulturists and home gardeners throughout North America, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association is comprised of 13 peat moss producers and marketers representing 96 percent of Canada's total production. Canada, the world's second largest peat producer and exporter of sphagnum peat moss for horticultural use, produces more than 95 percent of the sphagnum peat moss imported by the united states.   The association has a strict environmental policy that regulates the way peat bogs are harvested and restored.   The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has three levels of membership voting members, which includes all producers and brokers of Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; affiliate voting, which includes all the bag suppliers; and affiliate non-voting, which includes equipment suppliers, accountants, insurance agencies and other suppliers of our industry.   Peatlands are natural biological resources that provide an extensive range of values important to the environmental, social and economic interests of Canadians. Our nation's peatlands (113 million hectares) are the most extensive in the entire world. Our production of horticultural peat leads all other peat producing nations. Responsible management of this valuable resource is critically important to our industrial interests as well as the overall interest of Canadians. The Canadian peat moss industry is internationally recognised as a leader for its sustainable practices. Beginning in the 1980s, the industry committed time and financial resources to research. Working with universities and government agencies (such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), the industry invested more than 7 million dollars over the past 20 years to investigate techniques designed to accelerate the restoration of peatlands and the return of their ecological functions.   The industry took a step further in engaging with Veriflora® certification, which represents a standard of excellence in responsible management for peat moss production. Today, at least 65% of the peat harvested in Canada is certified under the Scientific Certification Systems Veriflora® Certification for Responsibly Managed Peatlands. The industry has also conducted social and environmental life cycle assessments that identified impacts generated by the sector and helped orientate future actions. In 2014, the first Industry Social Responsibility report was released. The goal of this report is to provide a benchmark for sustainable accounting of the industry's governance, social, environmental and economic impacts.",
